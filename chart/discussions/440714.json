Even deselecting item will not change yellow(selection) color to normal color.\r<br />\n<br />\n2) How we can change default colors of pie chart. Instead of blue, light blue etc. I would like to use different color.\r<br />\n<br />\n3) How to handle click event on pie chart for a area in chart.\r<br />\n<br />\n-Shyam<br />\n",

    "Html": "Hi Shyam,\r<br />\n<br />\nsorry for my late answer, I had to finish the BETA release of the charts :-)\r<br />\n<br />\nRegarding your questions:\r<br />\n<br />\n1) The bug in pie chart is fixed.\r<br />\n<br />\n2) In the new release you can change the color palette for the charts. You can fnd a sample in the test applications. You define your custom ResourceDictionaryCollection with all the color values and assign it to the chart in property &quot;Palette&quot;.\r<br />\n<br />\n3) To handle a click in the pie chart I would recommend to bind the property &quot;SelectedItem&quot; of the pie chart to your ViewModel and then you can react on changes of the SelectedItem (e.g. by switching to a different page). Currently there is no click event. If my recommendation does not help you please describe your use case and I could find a possible implementation in the charts.\r<br />\n<br />\nCheers,\r<br />\nTorsten<br />\n",
