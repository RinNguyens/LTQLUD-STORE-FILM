I need to react to the &quot;clicking&quot; of a chart value (i.e.: bar, pie segment, etc)) . I wasn't able to figure this out with playing with the UpdateSourceTrigger binding attribute.\r<br />\n<br />\n<strong>c)</strong> how can I clear out the selected chart value? I've tried setting the viewmodel property to null, but it didn't work. When using KeyValuePair and setting it to the default, it still didn't seem to clear it out.<br />\n",
