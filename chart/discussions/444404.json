    "Html": "Hi Torsten, I'm looking for a chart library for a would-be project (desktop, so wpf) related to furnace industry. In these last weeks I'm still collecting some pieces together (chart, report, schedule) to valuate them and then make my last decisions. I found your chart library very interesting, I think the gauge chart would be very good to show the progression of the furnace job using the dynamics of filling and colors (I downloaded the demo), and judging by the results it really seems you're doing a hard and good work. But it happens that most if not almost the whole job of the charts will be made by showing points and lines (three axes: x-time, y-temperature, y-nitrogen). So, missing this piece, as now, I can't (yet) make the final decision oriented toward the choosing of your library. Add this to the hurry to show a demo to the possible customer (needless to say, with no-no funding). So in the hope you fulfill all my necessities... :) keep up with the good work.\r<br />\nRegards\r<br />\nMaurizio<br />\n",

I have done this and I had nothing to do/change to &quot;integrate&quot; or &quot;tie most of the components together&quot;.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhat specifically are you having problems with in having these charts in your MUI application? All I did was use some of the colors/brushes defined in the MUI theme for some of the colors for the charts.
