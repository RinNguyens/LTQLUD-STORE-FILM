Great work!!!<br />\n<br />\nBut I also get some minor (I hope) problems.<br />\nBecause I can't recompile Your project (at the moment), I'm using debug library provided with source code. And I have problem with styling larger number of series. Everything after sixth series is red.<br />\nIs it posible to manually style further series without recompiling whole project? I just can't track Series styling point.<br />\n<br />\nBest regards.<br />\nKyroPL<br />\n",
