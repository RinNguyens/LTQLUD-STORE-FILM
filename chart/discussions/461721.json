The value can be like shown below:<br />\n<pre><code>&lt;chart:PieChart        \n        ToolTipFormat=&quot;{0} in Category {2} has Value {1}&quot;\n        &gt;\n&lt;/chart:PieChart&gt;</code></pre>\n\nYou need to try out which values are interesting for you. Currently the following 6 values can be used, in the following order:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Caption</li>\n<li>Value</li>\n<li>SeriesCaption</li>\n<li>PercentageFromMaxDataPointGroupSum</li>\n<li>PercentageFromMaxDataPointValue</li>\n<li>\nPercentageFromSumOfDataPointGroup<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nIf you are missing a value in this list please let me know.<br />\n<br />\nHope it helps.<br />\n<br />\nTorsten<br />\n",

Thanks. \r<br />\n<br />\nBen <br />\n",

    "Html": "First, thanks a lot for a wonferful library of charting controls. I have a little annoying problem about this ToolTipFormat property. I cant seem to find it!!! What am I missing here. I have looked everywhere but it just does not exist! Chart:PieChart has a ToolTip property (like every framework element) which is object and outputs the same string without any information on the bound values. same is the case for Chart:PieChart.Series... Please I would be grateful for any help. <br />\nIf it matters I just downloaded the nuget package for .NET WPF.<br />\n<br />\nEDIT 1: Also, I would like to mention that  by default the pie pieces are showing &quot;number&quot; as tooltip and I cant seem to override that at all even if I set the tooltip property in xaml or in code.<br />\n<br />\nWaqas<br />\n",
