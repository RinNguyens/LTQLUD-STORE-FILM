I have a quick question that i'm hoping someone could help me with.\r<br />\n<br />\nIn some cases I have a very simple chart requirement... 1 series, but lots of columns (up to 25 columns). I'd like to see the x value of each column underneath that specific column as the legend becomes difficult to follow. My x values are really short (in fact they are just numbers). If I add each value as a series with a single SeriesData (with 1 item), then I get really thin columns.\r<br />\n<br />\nExample Series:\r<br />\n<br />\nRounds:\r<br />\nX - Y\r<br />\n1 - 25\r<br />\n2 - 76\r<br />\n3 - 12\r<br />\n4 - 15\r<br />\n<br />\nSo here the X axis could have the Round Number (1,2,3,4 etc) and the Y axis would have the value (25, 76, 12, 15 etc). So there are 25 items in Round 1, 76 in Round 2 etc.\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm trying to get this:\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/tYj5ssX\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://imgur.com/tYj5ssX</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nI gather I would need to try change some data templates and add some more properties to some classes to carry the extra data. Can anyone point me in the right direction for a column or bar chart?<br />\n",
