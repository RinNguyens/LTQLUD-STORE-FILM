My project has a limitation that it should work with Windows XP and I cannot install framework 4.5 on Windows XP. If I try to use WPF DLL with my framework 4.0 project I get the following error!!<br />\n<pre><code>Error   2   The tag 'PieChart' does not exist in XML namespace 'clr-namespace:De.TorstenMandelkow.MetroChart;assembly=De.TorstenMandelkow.MetroChart'. Line 7 Position 10.  D:\\ESCENER\\Repo\\POS\\POS\\Window1.xaml    7   10  POS\n\nWarning 1   The primary reference &quot;De.TorstenMandelkow.MetroChart&quot; could not be resolved because it was built against the &quot;.NETFramework,Version=v4.5&quot; framework. This is a higher version than the currently targeted framework &quot;.NETFramework,Version=v4.0&quot;.  POS\n</code></pre>\n\nAny help on this issue is greatly appreciated.<br />\n",

The fix is applied in the ChartBase so should apply to all.\r<br />\n<br />\nObviously this is only me messing around trying to fix it for my WPF app and is relatively untested but certainly does work in .Net 4.\r<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://goo.gl/iGc7B8\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://goo.gl/iGc7B8</a><br />\n",
