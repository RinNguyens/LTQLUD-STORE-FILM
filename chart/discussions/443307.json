The demo app works great and the charts look amazing.\r<br />\n<br />\nI am trying to start from scratch using <a href=\"https://modernuicharts.codeplex.com/documentation#howto1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://modernuicharts.codeplex.com/documentation#howto1</a> but I can't get this one to work/show. Everything builds, runs, but no charts are shown. Am I missing something? The only thing I changed was the name of the view model (MainViewModel instead of TestPageViewModel)\r<br />\n<br />\nI did the binding to datacontext using:\r<br />\n<br />\nthis.DataContext = new MainViewModel();\r<br />\n<br />\nin the page constructor.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks!<br />\n",
