You are trying to install this package into a project that targets '.NETFramework,Version=v3.0', but the package does not contain any assembly references that are compatible with that framework. For\n more information, contact the package author\".\n\nYes, I tryed with all target framework version, starting 4.5 down to 3.0 (not tested 2.0).\n\nIs it a old package?
