    "Description": "Hi,\n\nThanks for the great control.\n\nI am developing a Metro app and I have three DoughnutChart chart controls in app. When I tapped on first one should display the second chart and tapped on second chart should display third chart and tapped on third chart should display first chart.\n\nMy problem is like, when I tapping continuously on chart control I am getting __\"Failed to assign to property 'Windows.UI.Xaml.Shapes.Path.Data'. [Line: 1105 Position: 51]\"__ issue. And this issue is not coming for all times, it's coming for randomly only.\n\nCan you please help me resolve the issue.\n\nRegards,\nChandra.",
