    "Description": "For some reason `SeriesTemplate` attribute is always processed AFTER `SeriesSource` when I set both of them in XAML. This prevents series initialization process that is performed in `OnSeriesSourceChanged` (ChartBase.cs). Thus the chart is not immediately visible after loading. Is there a workaround for this?",
