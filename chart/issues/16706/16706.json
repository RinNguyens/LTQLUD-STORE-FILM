      "Message": "I've run into the same problem using the NuGet package. Some spelunking revealed there was no ChartSeries.Caption property, but there was a ChartSeries.SeriesTitle property. Setting that made everything work. I assume the property name was changed at some point, but the error message is not at all helpful, and it's frustrating that if you leave SeriesTitle out the chart won't display even when that SeriesTitle isn't displayed.",
